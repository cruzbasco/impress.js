This class means, that browser doesn't\r\n    support features required by impress.js, so you should apply some fallback styles in your CSS.\r\n    It's not necessary to add it manually on this element. If the script detects that browser is not\r\n    good enough it will add this class, but keeping it in HTML means that users without JavaScript\r\n    will also get fallback styles.\r\n    \r\n    When impress.js script detects that browser supports all required features, this class name will\r\n    be removed.\r\n    \r\n    The class name on body element also depends on currently active presentation step.

Only `id` is important here as that's how the script find it.\r\n    \r\n    You probably won't need it now, but there are some configuration options that can be set on this element.\r\n    \r\n    To change the duration of the transition between slides use `data-transition-duration=\"2000\"` giving it\r\n    a number of ms. It defaults to 1000 (1s).\r\n    \r\n    You can also control the perspective with `data-perspective=\"500\"` giving it a number of pixels.\r\n    It defaults to 1000. You can set it to 0 if you don't want any 3D effects.\r\n    If you are willing to change this value make sure you understand how CSS perspective works:\r\n    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/perspective\r\n    \r\n    But as I said, you won't need it for now, so don't worry - there are some simple but interesting things\r\n    right around the corner of this tag ;)\r\n    \r\n-->\r\n<div id=\"impress\">\r\n\r\n    <!--\r\n        \r\n        Here is where interesting thing start to happen.\r\n        \r\n        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name\r\n        of `step`.

Not only because it's a good practice, but also\r\n    because it should be done when the whole document is ready.\r\n    Of course you can wrap it in any kind of \"DOM ready\" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)\r\n    \r\n-->\r\n<script src=\"js/impress.js\"></script>\r\n<script>impress().init();</script>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    \r\n    The `impress()` function also gives you access to the API that controls the presentation.\r\n    \r\n    Just store the result of the call:\r\n    \r\n        var api = impress();\r\n    \r\n    and you will get three functions you can call:\r\n    \r\n        `api.init()` - initializes the presentation,\r\n        `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,\r\n        `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation,\r\n        `api.goto( idx | id | element, [duration] )` - moves the presentation to the step given by its index number\r\n                id or the DOM element; second parameter can be used to define duration of the transition in ms,\r\n                but it's optional - if not provided default transition duration for the presentation will be used.\r\n    \r\n    You can also simply call `impress()` again to get the API, so `impress().next()` is also allowed.\r\n    Don't worry, it wont initialize the presentation again.\r\n    \r\n    For some example uses of this API check the last part of the source of impress.js where the API\r\n    is used in event handlers.\r\n    \r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    \r\n    Now you know more or less everything you need to build your first impress.js presentation, but before\r\n    you start...\r\n    \r\n    Oh, you've already cloned the code from GitHub?\r\n    \r\n    You have it open in text editor?\r\n    \r\n    Stop right there!\r\n    \r\n    That's not how you create awesome presentations. This is only a code. Implementation of the idea that\r\n    first needs to grow in your mind.\r\n    \r\n    So if you want to build great presentation take a pencil and piece of paper. And turn off the computer.\r\n    \r\n    Sketch, draw and write. Brainstorm your ideas on a paper. Try to build a mind-map of what you'd like\r\n    to present. It will get you closer and closer to the layout you'll build later with impress.js.\r\n    \r\n    Get back to the code only when you have your presentation ready on a paper. It doesn't make sense to do\r\n    it earlier, because you'll only waste your time fighting with positioning of useless points.\r\n    \r\n    If you think I'm crazy, please put your hands on a book called \"Presentation Zen\". It's all about \r\n    creating awesome and engaging presentations.\r\n    \r\n    Think about it. 'Cause impress.js may not help you, if you have nothing interesting to say.\r\n    \r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    \r\n    Are you still reading this?\r\n    \r\n    For real?\r\n    \r\n    I'm impressed! Feel free to let me know that you got that far (I'm @bartaz on Twitter), 'cause I'd like\r\n    to congratulate you personally :)\r\n    \r\n    But you don't have to do it now. Take my advice and take some time off. Make yourself a cup of coffee, tea,\r\n    or anything you like to drink. And raise a glass for me ;)\r\n    \r\n    Cheers!\r\n    \r\n-->\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
